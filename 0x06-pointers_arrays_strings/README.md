0x06. C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings
Overview
In this project, we delve deeper into C programming, focusing on pointers, arrays, and strings. We build on the foundational knowledge gained in previous projects and explore more advanced concepts to improve our understanding and proficiency in C programming.

Learning Objectives
Understand and apply the concept of pointers in C.
Work with multidimensional arrays.
Manipulate strings and perform various string operations.
Gain a deeper understanding of array pointers.
Learn about the "const" keyword and its use with pointers.
Files and Directories
The project contains various C source files and header files, each focusing on specific topics and exercises. Here is an overview of the key files and directories in this project:

0-strcat.c: Concatenate two strings.
1-strncat.c: Concatenate two strings, but only up to a specified number of characters.
2-strncpy.c: Copy a string into another, up to a specified number of characters.
3-strcmp.c: Compare two strings.
4-rev_array.c: Reverse the content of an array of integers.
5-string_toupper.c: Convert all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.
6-cap_string.c: Capitalize all words in a string.
7-leet.c: Encode a string into "leet" (1337) text.
8-rot13.c: Apply the ROT13 transformation to a string.
100-print_number.c: Print an integer using only the _putchar function.
