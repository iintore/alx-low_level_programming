0x14. C - Bit Manipulation
Description
This repository contains C programs that demonstrate bit manipulation techniques in the C programming language. The programs cover various operations and manipulations of bits, including setting, clearing, toggling, and checking specific bits in integers.

List of Programs
0-binary_to_uint.c: Converts a binary string to an unsigned integer.
1-print_binary.c: Prints the binary representation of an unsigned integer.
2-get_bit.c: Gets the value of a bit at a given index.
3-set_bit.c: Sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1.
4-clear_bit.c: Sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0.
5-flip_bits.c: Returns the number of bits needed to flip to convert one number to another.

Getting Started

To compile these programs, use a C compiler such as gcc
Then run the compiled program
